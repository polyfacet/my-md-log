Should I try to understand something, someone wrote that did not try to make it understandable?

## BUG 2379
This is an example of a "bug" that I was asked to fix. And the only abbreviation I was familiar with was GEQ. 
The implicitness of abbreviations is one minor detail. The main issue is that the used abbreviations does not add up. Title says one thing, description adds another abbreviation and omits mentioning project. 
Below is the specification as it was written, with the original abbreviations replaced.
